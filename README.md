## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5

### What I learned

  Centering the main content with justify-content and align-items.
  Creating flexible vertical alignment for the profile and links.
- Hover Effects:
  Improved user experience by styling hover states for interactive buttons.
- Semantic HTML:
  Used <main>, <section>, <footer>, and <h3> for better accessibility and structure.

### Continued development

- Implement responsive design with media queries for mobile and larger screen sizes.
- Explore CSS variables for easier theme customization.

### Useful resources
